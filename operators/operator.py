# operators is a symbol which is used to perform required operations

# 4 + 6 = 10

# here +, = are operators
# and 4,6 is operands

# 1.arthemtic

    # + ---- addtion
    # - ---- subtraction
    # * ---- multiplication
    # / ---- division
    # // ---- floor divid
    # ** ---- power
    # % ---- modulus




# 2.relational


    # 1. < ---- lessthan 
    # 2. > ---- graterthan
    # 3. <= ---- lessthan equal to 
    # 3. >= ---- greterthan equal to
    # 4. == ---- equal to
    # 5. != ---- not equal to 


# 3.asignment


    # = ---- asignment operator
    # += ---- add and assign
    # -= ---- subtract and assign
    # *= ---- multiplication and assign
    # /= ---- divid and assign
    # //= --- floor divid and assign
    # **= --- power and assign
    #  %= --- modulus and assing

# 4.logical

    #  and ---- return true if the both the conditions are ture else False
    #  or  ---- return ture if any one of the condions are ture or both the condions was ture else False

    #  not ---- return ture if conditon is False
    #           return False if cinditionn is True



# 5.membership


    #   These operators are used to check whether the value or element present in given sequence or not

    # in : return True if the value present in given sequence else False

    # not in : return True if the value is not present in given sequence else Flase

# 6.identity
    
        # These operator are used to check whether the variables or any python objec is having same identity or not
        # or diferent identity

        # is : return True if the variables are having same identity else false

        # is not: return True if the variable are not having sam identity else False
        
        # id() : it is a bultin function 
                #  it is used to find the memory address of the object 
                #  it will return a unique integer 





# 7.bitwiise    

    # bitwiise operators are used to perform bitwiise calcution and on integer numbers


    bitwiise AND(&)
    bitwiise OR (|)
    bitwiise XOR (^)
    bitwiise NOT (~)
    bitwiise left shift(<<)
    bitwiise right shift(>>)

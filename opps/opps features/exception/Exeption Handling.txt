Exception handling Mechanism :-
---------------------------
is the process to show alltranative way of the program excution sufully

1. Syntactical errors ---() , "",: worg spelling to the syntax

2. runtime erros ---- exception ------abnormal termination of program execution


1. logical implementation 

2. try except implementation



an unexpected or unwanted enevnt will disturb the normal flow of program execution is called exception



in python every exception is a class


1.name errors
2.type errors
3.value errors
4.zero division errors
5.file not found errors
6.file exist error 


Exception is the super class of all sub class exception



try:

   statements ---- here we write risky code

except:
     statements  ------ handling code



     We have 2 type of except block



   1. generic except block: except block without exception class

   2. specific except block : except block with exception class

-------------

   try:

      statement -1
      statement -2
      statement -3


   except:

      statement -4


   statement -5


   case 1: if there is no exception ,1,2,3,5 and normal termination

   case 2: if there is an excpetion at statement-2 ,1,4,5 and normal termination


   case3> if there is an excpetion at statment-2 but correspoding except block not  matched 1 4 5 and normal termination

1. instance methods 
-------------------

        inside the method implementation when we use instance variables
        then such type of methods are called instance methods

        while declaring instance method we should pass self 

        self is the first parameter of instance variables 

        we can access instance methods within the class by using self

        we can access instance methods outside of the class by using object reference 




2. class methods:-
-----------------


        class method are very rarely used methods in python

        inside the method implementation when we use only class level
        variables or static variables then such type of method are called class method


        while declaring class meethods we should pass class variable i.e cls

        using cls we can access static or class level variables

        to make a method as class method then we use @classmethod decorator

        we can access class methods either by using class name or object referance




3. static methods :-
-------------------

                static method are general utiliy methode
                according to programmer requiemen he/she can creae these methods
                with their own implementation .

                while declaring static methods we should not pass self or cls

                to make a method as static method then we use @staticmethod decoraror

                we can access static methods either by using classname or object reference.




Where we can decalare static variable
----------------------------------------

                1. inside the constructor by using self or classname
                2. inside the instance method by using self or classname
                3. inside the class methods by using cls or classname
                4. inside the static method by using classname
                5.  outside of the class by using object reference 



We can delete static  variable any where by using the following syntax


del classname.variablename

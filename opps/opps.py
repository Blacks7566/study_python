# Object Orientend Programming (oop's):

# ----------------------------------------------

# 1.security
# 2.reusability
# 3.app enhancement

# Class : is a collection variables and methods
#-------

# bird is a class





# Object: is an instance(reference) of class or it is used to represent a class 
#-------

# parrot is an objecg for bird class



# features of opp:
# ------------------

# 1.Encapsulation:-

        # is the process of providing restriction to access variables and methods
        # why we need encapsulation menas to prevent the data from modifications
        # we can achieve encapsutlation by using private variables and methos.




# 2.Abstraction:-

        # is the process of hiding the implementation but providing service or result
        




# 3.Polymorphism:-

        # poly means many and morph means behavior

        #1.static or compiletime ---- overloading ----refinement technique
        #1.dynamic or runtime ---- overriding ----replacement technique





# 4.Inheritance:-

        # is the process of creating new class from existing class
        # here existion class in treated as parent class or baseclass or super class 
        # here new class in treated as child class or derived class or sub class
        # in inheritance process always child class will get the all features from its parent class
        # the main advantage of inheritance is reusability and extensibity
    

    #1.single inheritance
    #2.multiple inheritance
    #3.multilevel inheritance
    #4.hybrid inheritance



    # Syntax of create a class:-
    #--------------------------

    # class className:

    # ex:- class Student:


    # Syntax of create object to class:
    #--------------------------------

    # objectname=classname()

#     ex: st1=Student()


# Constructor:
#-------------

                #1. constructor is a special method of class.
                #2. constructor is used to declare the variables an intialize the values to variables

                #3. in python constructor name should be __init__(self)
                #4. self is a special variable and it is the first parameter of constructor
                #5. using self we can access current class members
                #6. constructor will execute automatically when we create object to class.
                #7. we can create any no of object to the class
                #8. for every object constructor will execute once.


# method :
#---------




                #1. mehtod is a reusable piece of code which can be call again and again when it is required
                #2. inside the method we can any business lagic code.
                #3. method name can be of any valid name
                #4. self is a spwcial variable and it is the first parameter of method
                #5. method will excute only when we call method
                #6. for every object we can call method many  times

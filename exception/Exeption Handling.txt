Exception handling Mechanism :-
---------------------------
is the process to show alltranative way of the program excution sufully

1. Syntactical errors ---() , "",: worg spelling to the syntax

2. runtime erros ---- exception ------abnormal termination of program execution


1. logical implementation 

2. try except implementation



an unexpected or unwanted enevnt will disturb the normal flow of program execution is called exception



in python every exception is a class


1.name errors
2.type errors
3.value errors
4.zero division errors
5.file not found errors
6.file exist error 


Exception is the super class of all sub class exception



try:

   statements ---- here we write risky code

except:
     statements  ------ handling code



     We have 2 type of except block



   1. generic except block: except block without exception class

   2. specific except block : except block with exception class



exception2.py
-------------

   try:

      statement -1
      statement -2
      statement -3


   except:

      statement -4


statement -5


      case 1: if there is no exception ,1,2,3,5 and normal termination

      case 2: if there is an excpetion at statement-2 ,1,4,5 and normal termination


      case3:  if there is an excpetion at statment-2 but correspoding except block not  matched 1 4 5 and normal termination

      case 4: if there is an exception at statement -4 
               then it is always 






finallys.py
--------------



try: 
   statements ----- risky code

except:
     statements ------ handing code

finally:
      statemnets ------ mandatory messages



      there is only one situstion where we can stop the execution of finally block










import os

OS._exit(0)  --- pvm will shut down itself (pvm - python vartual machin)


this function can stop the excution of finally block



Nested try except finally block :-

__________________________________

a try block or except block or finally block which is having one more try except finally block is called
nested try except finally block
